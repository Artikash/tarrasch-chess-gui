================    ======================

Belatedly creating a place where we can store stuff we created to
help with the project - meta source code as opposed to source code.

Some things have no doubt got lost, but at least here we have

BuildLookupTables.cpp;
Which builds .cpp code for fast move generation etc. The esulting code
used to be in GeneratedLookupTables.inc but is now in thc.cpp and thc.h

icon-scan.cpp;
Which we used to study and manipulate Tarrasch9Squares.ico and
Tarrasch4Squares.ico

bmp-experiments-and-transformations.cpp;
Project to enable resizable adobe acrobat rendered chess graphics
